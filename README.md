## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project acts as a basic Boilerplate for our API-based applications, allowing us to rapidly prototype our systems.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [PostgresSQL (v12.x)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/tutorial-install.html)
* [Node.js (v12.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [npm (Node Package Manager) (v6.x.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)
* [Sequelize CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-cli)

 Sequelize CLI can be installed locally for the project, however that will require you call sequelize using  ```./node_modules/.bin/sequelize``` so I would suggest installing sequelize-cli globally with the ```-g``` flag. 
```
npm i -g sequelize-cli
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
